# Cmake Web Templating

Cmake Web Templating is designed to enable automatic web site generation from raw-structured data. Its current implementation use yaml format for data and mustache-templated html with css collections.

Main degsign goals are (in order of importance):

  - easy and usable by non-geek people (maybe too optimistic ...)
  - part of an industrial/engineering workflow of infromation production/management (see [GÃ©rer la documentation comme le code source](http://redaction-techniqueorg.readthedocs.io/fr/1.3/documentation-code-source-de-la-redaction-a-la-communication-technique.html))
  - separation of concerns
  - structured (ideally semantic) management of data
  - friend with light-weight-web-framework
  - front-end web framework agnostic

Cmake may seem to be a weird choice in web technology, but it have many interesting features. It is:

  - a multiplatform scripting language
  - easilly available almost on every machine/platform
  - design to build and update things wisely
  - light-weight
